	description="
With Healing Flames, fire heals all wounds. The challenge with this new power is staying lit.
Soaked cloaks are hard to burn, so try to keep dry (the perk that freezes all liquids can be
helpful). Healing Flames also removes the protection from fire and oil blood perks, which would
prevent ignition if acquired. Adjust healing rate in settings. Adjustments take effect upon game
start/restart. Beware, explosions and lava still hurt!"
