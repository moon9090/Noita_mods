# Healing Flames

With Healing Flames, fire heals all wounds. The challange with this new power is staying lit. Soaked cloaks are hard to burn, so try to keep dry (the perk that freezes all liquids is helpful). Healing Flames also removes the protection from fire perk, which would prevent ignition, if accidentally acquired. Adjust healing rate in settings. Adjustments take effect upon game start/restart. Beware, explosions and lava still hurt!
