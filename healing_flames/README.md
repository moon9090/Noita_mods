# Healing Flames

With Healing Flames, fire heals all wounds. The challenge with this new power is staying lit.
Soaked cloaks are hard to burn, so try to keep dry. Healing Flames also removes the fire protection
perk and all fire protection effects from other perks (e.g., oil blood), which prevent ignition.
Adjust healing rate in settings. Adjustments take effect upon game start. Beware, explosions and
lava are good ignition sources, but they still hurt!
